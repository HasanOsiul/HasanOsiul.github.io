# CryptoSite

A static, interactive website demonstrating basic cryptographic algorithms.

## How to Run

1. Clone or download this folder.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.

## Features

- Encrypt & decrypt text (typed or from .txt file).
- 6 algorithms: Caesar, Reverse, Vigenère, Playfair, AES, RSA.
- Download each result as a `.txt` file.

## File Structure

```
crypto-site/
├── index.html
├── css/style.css
├── js/main.js
├── algorithms/ciphers.js
└── README.md
```

## Team Roles

1. Developer – HTML/CSS layout & file handling  
2. Algorithm Lead – cipher implementations  
3. Tester/Doc – testing, documentation, reflections  

## Next Steps

1. Add explanations for each algorithm.  
2. Get feedback from two peers.  
3. Write individual reflections.  
4. Link each member's portfolio to this site.
